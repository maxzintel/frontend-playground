## HTML Fundamentals and Practice.

### Notes:
#### Intro:
* **HTML = The Structure.** Contains text, images tied to the text, and, in general, groups things together.
* **CSS = The Blueprint.** The rules of what goes where, the colors, sizes, fonts, backgrounds, etc...
  * Like HTML, it doesn't actually _do_ anything, it is just a set of rules to determine how things work/look.
* **Frontend/Client Javascript = The Smart Home.** Pre-programmed stuff you can tell your house to do.
* **Backend Javascript = The Pizza Place.** Where we can request things and get what we ask for.
